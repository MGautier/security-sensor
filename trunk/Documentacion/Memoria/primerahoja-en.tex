\begin{abstract}
  The main objective of the project is to develop a software to collect and display information generated by monitoring applications and security control running on a machine.\\

  The motivation arises because of the need to monitor a corporate network through a mechanism of automated event management (SIEM). The steps for the realization of this system are modularized and divided into different stages to be developed as a whole within the research project VERITAS (\url{http://nesg.ugr.es/veritas/}) fo Network Engineering \& Security Group (NESG - \url{http://nesg.ugr.es/}) belonging to the area of Telematic Engineering of the University of Granada.\\

  For this purpose it is necessary to define the steps to obtain logs of a security source, configure the installation for that source, perform system parsing logs to extract the information, stored in a persistent system (database) and view via a web interface on the probe deployed.\\

  Finally, to test the efectiveness and analyze the performance of the software solution, a demonstration would be done with actual live event processing for security source project whose scope has to be Iptables.\\
